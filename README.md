# cnn-damage-detection

This repository contains code for structural damage detection using data-driven and evolutionary machine learning methods. The project explores symbolic modeling and genetic programmingâ€“style approaches for predicting damage states, fitness evaluation, and visualization of structural response.

Features

Custom fitness function for structural performance evaluation.

Evolutionary training with recombination, mutation, and inversion operators.

Support for symbolic gene decoding (decode_gene) and analysis.

Visualization of models and results using Matplotlib.

Modular functions for extending to different datasets and structural problems.

Requirements

Python 3.8+

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourNameHere/damage-detection-ml.git
cd damage-detection-ml


Run the training pipeline:

python main.py


Example workflow:

Preprocess structural datasets (X_tr, y_tr).

Train model using train_once().

Evaluate predictions with fitness() function.

Visualize using built-in plotting utilities.

Example Functions

fitness(ind, X_tr, y_tr) â€“ Evaluates structural model accuracy.

train_once(...) â€“ Runs one evolutionary training cycle.

decode_gene(sym) â€“ Decodes symbolic representation of candidate solutions.

recomb_two(p1, p2, GENE_SZ) â€“ Performs recombination between two individuals.

Future Work

Extend to CNN-based defect image classification for steel beams.

Integrate with NDT and vibration data for multimodal damage detection.

Deploy within a digital twin framework for reclaimed steel structures.
